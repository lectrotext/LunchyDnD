We defeat the Deep ones and are on the pathway of sand.
Turning back towards the north, the path continues.

As we go north, broadens to east west, we see a black thing set
into a huge coral tree. We make out a stand of coral trees,
set into the trees is a smooth Onyx door. Etched in a vertical line
down the center are strange runes, 2 dials on each side.
Each have a 5 pointed star on them.

Cro touches the door and puts them both at 2 O'clock.
Takes 2 poits of damage as he is electrically shocked.

Fort saves:
 Rachel now has bug eyes.
 Robert is double mutated, lost a point of personality.
 Cro has double mutated, increased strength +1 to strength.
 Those who mutate twice have webbed toes and fingers.
 +3 to fumbles now.

Eammon spends a point of luck and figures out the runes on the door says to point
at specific constellations right 10 left 7 oclock.
Eammon moves left dial then right dial into place. It does nothing when
he touches the left one. Both at the same time work.

We open the door. We all get an exp point.

The door opens upward, like a garage door, revealing a large tunnel with
smooth walls that twists down into the darkness.

Miriam is like "hey im going to go in front now and be weird and crazy. She
makes a bunch of noise and goes stomping all over the place"

The sound echoes down the tunnel.

Robert grabs Miriam.

A strange wind wafts over us. Fortitude saves:
    Whiff: mutated: get bug eyes +2 points of strength
    Dwigt: mutated: get bug eyes +1 agility -1 luck
    Cro: Thrice mutated: now he has claws. id3+1 dmg. any time he touches someone, 25% might hurt him. +1 strength -1 luck
    Miriam: -1 personality -1 luck
